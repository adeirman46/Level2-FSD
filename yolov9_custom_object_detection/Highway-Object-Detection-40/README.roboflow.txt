The dataset includes 2442 images.
Cars-truck-bus-people-motorcycle are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 1 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
